- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kumomie and I'm from germany.
- 👀 I’m interested in games, music, programming, ... other things ...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of different stuff, down below is a list of things I have experience with.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything. I look forward to a fun, productive and informative work environment.
- 📫 How to reach me: My E-Mail is set to private, so please contact me via GitHub. 

If someone works on something cool or needs some help, contact me. I would like to meet new people too. :)

I have experience or had a go with:
- Spring / Spring Boot
- HTML / CSS / JS
- Java
- C#
- C++
- Unity
- Typescript
- Node.js
- Databases
- Setting up servers (nginx, certbot, firewall, ports, ...)

Another positive point, I guess, is a successfull graduation of university with a bachelor degree in informatics.
