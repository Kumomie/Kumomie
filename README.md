- 👋 Hi, I'm from germany.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything. I look forward to a fun, productive and informative work environment.

If someone works on something cool or needs some help, contact me. I would like to meet new people too. :)

I have experience or had a go with:
- Java (My main focus)
- Spring / Spring Boot
- HTML / CSS / JS
- Angular / Vue.js / Thymeleaf
- C++
- Typescript
- Node.js
- Databases (Postgres, Oracle)
- Setting up servers (nginx, certbot, firewall, ports, ...)

I like to learn new things.

Not a cultist, btw.
