- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kumomie
- 👀 I’m interested in games, music, programming, ..., idk some other things too, I guess
- 🌱 I’m currently learning alot.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything.
- 📫 How to reach me: By sending an email or contact me via github (if that's a thing)

If someone works on something cool or needs some help, contact me. I just need to check my mails ... (I'm not doing this that regularly) 

I have experience or had a go with:
- Spring / Spring Boot
- HTML / CSS / JS
- Java
- C#
- C++
- Unity
- Typescript
- Node, express
- Setting up servers (nginx, certbot, firewall, ports, ...)

I have successfully finished university.

So that's all.
